## Zoo Animal Matching Game (for Kids!)

* As a user on the landing/home page: I can learn about animals and navigate to the game page or the leaderboard.

* As user on the game page I can see 4 randomly generated animal names and pictures.  I can click on a picture and then the animal name it corresponds to to attempt to match.  

* A tally of correct matches will be displayed along with # of attempts.  Once all animals have been matched the game will be ended and scores recorded in the leaderboard database.

* As a user on the leaderboard database I can view a past history of my recent progress.

Summary: Game to help kids learn to match animal up pictures with their names and have fun doing it!  Do your best to match the 4 images on the right with the 4 animal names on the left!  You can view your previous history to see how many attempts it took you to get the correct match.
