## Zoo Animal Matching Game (for Kids!)

As a user on the landing/home page: I can enter my name and navigate to the game page or the leaderboard.

As user on the game page I can see 4 randomly generated animal facts and pictures.  Once I am ready I can proceed to the matching page where I will need to click on a picture and then the animal name it corresponds to.  If I match correctly some visually pleasing css will get triggered.  A tally of correct vs incorrect matches will be displayed.  Once all animals have been matched the game will be ended and scores recorded in the leaderboard database.

As a user on the leaderboard database I can view a past history of my recent progress.

Game to help kids learn to match animal up pictures with their names and have fun doing it!  Do your best to match the 4 images on the right with the 4 animal names (and facts) on the left!  You can view your previous history to see how many attempts it took you to get the right answers.
